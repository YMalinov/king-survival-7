King Survival 7

The King is initially located at row 7 and column 3 and the pawns are located at row 0 and columns 0, 2, 4 and 6. A pawn
can only move at neighbor cell down-left or down-right, while the King can go to neighbor cells in 4 directions: 
down-left, down-right, up-left and up-right. The pawns and the King cannot step outside the chess-board or on a cell
that is already occupied. The game is first started by moving the King. At the odd turns the player moves the King and
at the even steps the player moves the pawns. Thus the player in fact plays against himself. To make a move the player
issues a command consisting of the name of the figure, i.e. "K", followed by the direction to move, e.g. "KUL" means
King-Up-Left, "ADL" means Pawn-A-Down-Left. Thus all possible commands are 12: KUL, KUR, KDL, KDR, ADL, ADR, BDL, BDR,
CDL, CDR, DDL and DDR.
